# GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are a fascinating and powerful class of machine learning models known for their ability to create stunningly realistic fake data. 
Imagine generating new faces, painting landscapes that look like photographs, or even composing convincing melodies - that's the magic of GANs.


It is the combination of two neural network, namely Discriminator and Generator.
Discriminator (The detective) - It is the simple neural network, which just distinguish between real and fake (0 or 1), produced by the generator.
Generator - It is a neural network which takes random noise or simple data as input and tries to transform it into realistic examples that resemble the target data the GAN is trained on.
